Title: Determines minimum gene expression parameters and estimates costs for RNA-Seq analysis
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kevin Stevenson
Maintainer: Kevin Stevenson <kevin71@mail.usf.edu>
Description: This package contains functions for RNA-Seq gene expression analysis. Includes functions to calculate if 
    gene of interest meets the minimum 50 RPKM threshold value for it to be considered expressed. Also contains a function
    for accurate single-cell RNA-Seq gene expression analysis and cell type identification criteria. A RNA-Seq run cost
    estimation function based on number of lanes, conditions, and replicates is included in addition to datasets to use 
    to tests the functions.
